# HW2

This repository contains David Coit's submission for homework assignment #2 for the Machine Learning class at NYU Sackler, Fall 2019.

I saved a new copy of the regression_homework.Rmd, submitting my answers in a new file called Coit_David_HW_2.Rmd (with accompanying .html file). 

Where appropriate, my question responses or comments are bolded for ease of identification.
